# Flower-Classifier-ML
ML model for flower classification.
Setup the caffe(http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)file use this link --
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html

That should provide you with the detail to create the ML model. 
You will need to use https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coremltools to create a script to covert the caffe file into a Core ML file then you will be able to use it in your iOS app.
